Zip-Search is a Command Line Interface program which allows users to search up all the Zip Codes in the U.S. and obtain information about the respective city, county and state. Users can check if a Zip Code exists, retrieve information about a Zip Code, remove Zip Codes from the database and add a Zip Code to the database by providing all the relevant information.

The program makes use of a Red Black Tree to store the Zip Codes and it's relevant information in order to allow for quicker lookups.

Run `CommandLineDriver.java` without any arguments to start up the Command Line Interface
